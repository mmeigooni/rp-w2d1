# Warmup

## Instructions

1. In your starter project, open the files in the `w1d4` directory. 
2. Find a partner (preferably one that you have not yet worked with), and work
   through the following exercises as a pair.

## Exercises

1. Write descriptions in plain English of the two steps required to solve a
   problem using the style of repetition that we learned yesterday.

2. Complete the function `sumOfSquares` that computes the sum of all the numbers
   from `0` to `n`, but where each number is *squared*.

   ```js
   function sumOfSquares(n) {
     // TODO: your code here
   }
   sumOfSquares(5);
   // => (5 * 5) + (4 * 4) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) + (0 * 0) => 55
   ```

3. Write a function called `sumEvens` that works like the other summation
   functions that you've written, but only sums the *even* numbers between `0`
   and `n`.
